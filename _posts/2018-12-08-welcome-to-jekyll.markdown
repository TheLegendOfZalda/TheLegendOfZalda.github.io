## Abstract
In 2015, Hillary Clinton has been embroiled in controversy over the use of personal email accounts on non-government servers during her time as the United States Secretary of State. Over 2000 confidential emails were leaked, some of them are even classified as “Top Secret”. 

In this project we will look at the politic, security and economic aspects through the 7945 leaked emails redacted and published by the State Department and cleaned by Kaggle. We also want to analyze the personal social network of Hillary Clinton and the top topics they discussed.

As a superpower, the United States has a great impact on the world’s stability, and their position and attitude will strongly influence the international affairs. We want to figure out the countries mainly mentioned, the problems concerned and conclude the impact they made on the international affairs throughout the analysis of these emails.

The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/hillary-clinton-emails).

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
